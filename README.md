## Introduction
Mild cognitive impairment(MCI) and Alzheimer's diseases(AD) diagnosis can be implemented by assessing multifaceted measures including behavioral (VR), neurological(EP, EEG), and structural(EEG, MRI) changes. Currently, research on individual measures of VR, EP, EEG, and MRI is in progress, but the relationship between the measures and how to integrate multi-faceted measures into one is still unclear. Furthermore, to utilize this integrated information for early diagnosis of dementia, convergence research between engineering and clinical is required. 
</br></br>
Using machine learning and the latest deep learning technology (e.g., TSC-CNN, Multimodal Deep Learning, etc.), this basic research laboratory aims 1) to identify the relationship between VR, EP, EEG, and MRI measures in early diagnosis of MCI and AD, and 2) to develop “VEEM Biomarkers” that can be used in clinical practice for the first time in the world.
